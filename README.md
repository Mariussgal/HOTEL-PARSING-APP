# HOTEL-PARSING-APP
Introducing the Hotel Parser App! ðŸŒŸ This innovative tool employs two sorting algorithms to swiftly recommend your ideal stay, considering everything from budget to amenities. Announcing execution times for each algorithm, discover how it sifts through data and optimizes your hotel search. Dive in for a hassle-free travel planning experience! 

## Description
In the bustling world of travel, finding the perfect hotel that aligns with your preferences, budget, and needs can often feel like searching for a needle in a haystack. The Hotel Parser App emerges as a beacon of convenience, leveraging sorting algorithms and Python libraries like `Tkinter` for the graphical user interface, `Customtkinter` for enhanced UI design, `Requests` for fetching data from the web, `PIL` for image processing, and a few more. Simplify your journey with just a few clicks, and let us guide you to your ideal stay.


## Features
- **Price Sorting:** Quickly sort hotels based on their price.
- **Rating Sorting:** Sort hotels according to user ratings, ensuring that the recommended hotel is highly regarded by previous guests.
- **Experience Sorting:** Helping travelers find accommodations that match their expectations and preferences.
- **WiFi Filtering:** Filter hotels based on WiFi availability.


## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Python libraries: `Requests`, `csv`, `io`,`PIL`, `tkinter`, `Customtkinter`, `time`.
- Internet: The app utilizes hotel data from GitHub. Ensure you have an internet connection for the app to fetch data.
- Dataset link: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sachinnpraburaj/Intelligent-Travel-Recommendation-System/master/tripadvisor_hotel_output/hotel_info_dedup.csv"


## Installations to be Made
1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
2. Install the required dependencies by executing in the terminal: `pip install csv requests Pillow tkinter Customtkinter`
3. Dont forget to download the wallpaper so it can be displayed on the app


## Usage
To use this script, navigate to your file : cd C:\path\to\your\file

then run it in your terminal: `python apptkinter.py`

When the script is executed, the tkinter app will open and you will be prompted to chose what filters you want to apply. 

Review Execution Times: Take note of the execution times for each sorting algorithm provided by the app. This information can help you understand the efficiency of the sorting process.

Dataset Link: Don't forget that the app utilizes hotel data from GitHub. Ensure an internet connection is available for the app to fetch data from this source.
